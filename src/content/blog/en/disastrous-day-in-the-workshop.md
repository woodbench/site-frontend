There are days when you wake up inspired, full of amazing project ideas. And then, there are those other days. The ones where everything goes so wrong that you think, “Why didn’t I just stay in bed?” This is the story of one of those days in the workshop.

It started well, as usual. A cup of coffee, tools ready, and the excitement of building a small shelf for the workshop. Nothing complicated, I thought. Just a few boards, some glue, and screws. Easy.

The first mistake came quickly. I decided to cut the boards without measuring twice because, of course, I trusted my “trained eye.” By the time I finished, I had four pieces of the same size... but the design needed two longer ones. First break of the day to recalculate and cut new boards.

When I finally got to assembly, I felt confident again. I grabbed the glue and thought, “Better too much than too little.” And oh, there was too much! While clamping the boards, the glue overflowed like a sticky waterfall. My workshop looked like a failed science experiment.

But the final blow came with the screws. Everything seemed to be in place, until I flipped the structure to admire my work. That’s when I realized I had screwed the shelf on the wrong side! The whole thing was completely upside down.

I stood there, staring at my creation—glue everywhere, misplaced screws, and boards full of unnecessary cut marks. That’s when I accepted it: it wasn’t my day. I closed the workshop, washed my hands (more like peeled them apart), and decided the best thing to do was laugh.

That’s woodworking for you. Some days everything flows, and others it feels like even your saw is against you. But you know what? It’s these disastrous days that leave the best stories to tell.

So, if something like this ever happens to you, don’t worry. It happens to all of us. Laugh it off, learn from the mess, and tomorrow will be another day to return to the workshop.

What about you? Ever had a day when it felt like the workshop was out to get you? Tell me about it—I’d love to hear your story.
