There are lessons in woodworking that you learn from books and tutorials, and others that can only be taught by a good hammer blow... literally.

Some time ago, I was working on a simple project: a floating shelf. My plan was something straightforward and elegant, but the universe had other ideas. There I was, confident, holding a nail with one hand while wielding the hammer with the other, as if I were in some kind of extreme DIY competition.

First strike: _bam!_ The nail went in like butter. Second strike: a bit crooked, but acceptable. Third strike: _WHAM!_... my finger screamed what my pride refused to admit. I had missed in such a spectacular way that even the hammer seemed to look at me with pity.

While I danced around the workshop holding my finger, my dog (a silent witness to my failures) decided it was the perfect moment to sit on the wood. Yes, on the unfinished shelf. Now, not only did I have an injured finger, but a project with a perfectly stamped paw print.

The moral of the story: woodworking doesnâ€™t always go as planned, but the anecdotes are always worth it. Every missed hammer strike, every warped board, and every unexpected paw print are part of the journey. And if you ever feel like the wood is beating you, remember: you can always blame the dog.
