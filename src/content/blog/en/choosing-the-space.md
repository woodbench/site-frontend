## Choosing the Space

Hello everyone! I’m excited to share the beginning of a new chapter in my life: creating my own woodworking workshop. As I dive into this fascinating world, I want to take you along on the journey of preparation and share my expectations for this special space.

I know that choosing the right space for my workshop is crucial. Unfortunately, I don’t have many options at the moment, so I’ll be converting my shed into a workshop. This space isn’t big enough to work comfortably, but I can always use the backyard if I need more room. Right now, I’m in the process of adapting the space, making sure it’s functional and pleasant to work in. In the future, I plan to build a double garage out of wood: one space for the car and the other to set up my workshop, which will be a bit roomier. Many people have started without a proper space, working in parking lots, backyards, or even on the sidewalk in front of their homes. The important thing is to get started!

## Tools and Equipment

One of the most exciting aspects is choosing tools. I’ve been researching and have made a list of essential tools I need, such as a drill, a circular saw, a jigsaw, and a sander. I already have the drill and circular saw, as well as a set of chisels, some drill bits, and screwdriver tips. I’m planning to buy safety gear, including goggles, hearing protection, gloves, and masks. Additionally, I’m thinking about how to organize my tools so they’re easy to access and the workshop stays tidy.

## Woodworking Materials

As for materials, I’m considering which type of wood to use for my first projects. I’d love to work with high-quality materials. I’m particularly interested in ash, oak, and cherry; the latter fascinates me the most for its beautiful color. However, I plan to start with softer woods like pine, eucalyptus, and cedar, or even plywood, as they’re easier to work with.

## Workshop Design and Decoration

A workshop shouldn’t just be functional; I also want it to be neat and efficient. I’m considering some organization ideas, like French cleats, to hang tools and accessories and save space. This system isn’t just visually appealing; as I acquire more tools and materials, I can rearrange the cleats and reorganize the space quickly and easily. I want to create an environment that motivates me to be creative and efficient.

## Expectations and Goals

My expectations for the workshop are high. In the short term, I hope to complete some simple projects, like cutting boards, floating shelves, French cleats for tool organization, and a workbench. In the long term, I’d like to perfect my skills and create more complex pieces. This workshop represents a space of creativity, relaxation, and connection to woodworking for me.
