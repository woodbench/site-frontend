When I was just starting out in woodworking, I made a very common mistake: I was swayed by the appearance and the features I read about a wood that, at the time, seemed incredible to me. I had fallen in love with oak, a strong, heavy wood with a beautiful finish. Without much experience, I told myself, “Why not? How hard can it be to work with one wood versus another?” Well, I found out quickly, and it wasn’t an easy path.

I began working with this oak, but I soon encountered countless problems. Oak is a hardwood, and as a novice with limited tools, every cut took forever. By the time I made any progress, the edges were poorly finished, and the worst part was realizing how difficult it was to join pieces of this wood. Every nail or screw felt like a challenge, and my frustration kept growing.

### The First Big Lesson: Pine as a Savior (and a Challenge)

After struggling so much with oak, I kept hearing great things about pine. “It’s easy to work with, lightweight, affordable,” they said. So I decided to give it a try, and it was a relief. Pine is much softer, which makes it easier to cut and sand. I quickly noticed I could make faster progress with my projects, and as a beginner, that gave me a lot of motivation.

However, pine has its quirks. Being a softwood, it’s easy to dent if you’re not careful. I remember one project in particular: I was working on a bookshelf, and just as I was about to finish, I accidentally dropped one of the pieces. The impact left such a deep dent that it completely ruined the finish. I ended up having to start over, which taught me to be much more careful at every step of the process.

### Phenolic Plywood: My Versatile Companion
After gaining some experience with pine, I decided to take on something a bit more technical: phenolic plywood. I was interested in it for building more resistant structures, and after some research, I discovered it’s an excellent option for projects that require moisture resistance, making it ideal for outdoor projects.

Phenolic plywood, also known as phenolic board, is made of thin layers of wood glued together with a phenolic resin, giving it extra moisture resistance. Unlike regular plywood, which is also made of wood layers, phenolic plywood stands out because its layers are better suited for more demanding conditions.

For example, if you were building outdoor furniture, phenolic plywood would hold up better in the environment, even if both materials (phenolic and regular plywood) were treated for moisture resistance. This is because the resins binding the layers in phenolic plywood make it more water-resistant from its base composition.

### Quality Codes: My Challenge with Wood Faces

When I started working with phenolic plywood, I also came across another detail: the quality codes of the faces. You might have seen terms like AA, AB, or DD when buying a board. These codes refer to the quality of the wood surfaces. The letters indicate how smooth and defect-free the surface is: AA means both faces are of excellent quality, while DD implies both faces have significant defects. And this is where I got a surprise.

I thought I was buying high-quality phenolic plywood, but the seller clarified that what I had in my hands was “OSB-like.” At first, I didn’t understand the difference, but then he explained that while the board had the structure of phenolic plywood, the faces were full of defects, resembling OSB (another type of composite material that’s less refined).

### Final Thoughts

Over time, I learned that every type of wood has its pros and cons, and not all are ideal for every project. Pine, despite being soft and prone to dents, is perfect for beginners or simple indoor furniture. Phenolic plywood, on the other hand, is an excellent choice for projects requiring resistance and durability, especially for outdoor or humid conditions.

Now I ask you: What type of wood did you use for your first project? Did you encounter any unexpected challenges like I did? I’d love to hear about your experience, so leave your comment below. Let’s share our learnings!
