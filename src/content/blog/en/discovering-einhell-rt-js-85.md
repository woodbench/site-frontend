Hello everyone! I’m excited to share that I’ve finally purchased a jigsaw, the Einhell RT-JS 85. After a long time searching and analyzing different models, I decided that this would be the perfect tool for my projects.

One of the most important decisions I made was to go for a corded jigsaw instead of a cordless one. There are several reasons why I chose this option. First, the consistent power that a corded tool offers is hard to beat. When working on long cuts or thicker materials, I know I won’t have to worry about battery life or losing power. This gives me the confidence to tackle large projects without interruptions.

Additionally, corded jigsaws tend to be lighter and more compact, which makes them easier to handle for more precise cuts. In my experience, using cordless tools sometimes means the weight of the battery can make the tool a bit unbalanced. So, for tasks that require precision, such as angled cuts or fine details, a corded jigsaw seemed like the best choice.
From the first use, the 750W power surprised me. While cutting wood, I noticed that the machine doesn’t falter, even with thicker pieces I feared might cause issues. The jigsaw performed wonderfully, giving me great confidence in its capabilities.

### Discovering the Features

One feature I really liked is the pendulum motion adjustment. At first, I didn’t fully understand its purpose, but after experimenting with it, I discovered how it affects cutting speed. When I need faster cuts or face tough materials, I can increase the intensity; for more controlled finishes, I simply lower it. It’s like having several jigsaws in one.

The speed regulator has also been a great discovery. Being able to adjust the speed according to the type of material I’m cutting is incredibly useful. For example, on softer woods, I can increase the speed for more efficient cutting, while for harder materials, I prefer to lower it to maintain better control and achieve a cleaner finish.

### Blade Versatility

The Einhell RT-JS 85 comes with a set of saw blades, which I consider a real bonus. It includes three types of blades, each designed for different purposes. The wood blade has been perfect for my cuts on pine and beech, providing a clean and quick cut with smooth edges. I haven’t had the chance to use the metal blade yet, which is ideal for thin sheets or tubes, but I know it’ll be useful for future projects. I also have the blade for composite materials, which is excellent for cutting MDF and plywood, allowing me to work on different panels with ease.

What I love most about this jigsaw is how easily I can change the blades without needing additional tools. This allows me to switch between different materials or adjust the type of cut I need at any moment without wasting time. Instead of interrupting the workflow to find tools, I simply make the change in seconds, completely transforming the experience. This agility not only optimizes time but also gives me greater creative freedom and precision in every project. Working this way is truly a luxury that makes the whole process much more efficient and enjoyable.

### Dust Management and Clean Workspace

Another feature I’ve loved is the option to connect a vacuum cleaner. At first, I wasn’t prepared for the amount of dust cutting generates. Connecting the vacuum cleaner not only keeps my workspace cleaner, but the built-in dust blower also helps keep the cutting line clear, which is perfect for not losing track.

### The Downsides

Of course, not everything is perfect. The jigsaw is a bit heavy, and after using it for a while, you can definitely feel it in your hands. For those looking for an extremely lightweight tool for fine detail cuts, this might be something to consider. As for noise, it’s quite loud, especially when working with harder woods. If you’re planning a large project, it’s a good idea to use hearing protection. This is common with tools like this, but it’s worth mentioning.

One thing that could have made a difference is if it included a laser guide, which other models from the brand offer. It’s not essential, but I think it would have helped align cuts more precisely on certain projects.

### **Conclusion**

Overall, I’m very happy with my new acquisition. The Einhell RT-JS 85 has been an excellent choice and has opened up a world of possibilities for more precise and creative cuts. Although I’ve found some downsides, I believe it’s a great addition to my workshop, and I’m sure it’ll accompany me in many projects to come. I can’t wait to share my next creations with you!
