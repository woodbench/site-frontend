When I started woodworking, I thought the most important thing was what _I_ wanted to do with the wood. I had my tools, my plans, and a clear idea in my head. But over time, I learned something that changed the way I work: wood has something to say too. And if you don’t listen, it will remind you—with splinters or, worse, a ruined project.

Let me tell you about something that happened to me. I was cutting a board for a shelf I had envisioned perfectly. Everything was going smoothly until the saw started making a weird sound—like it was complaining. What did I do? I ignored it. I was too focused on making progress to pay attention to a sound. When I finished the cut, I found a huge crack running through the middle of the board. It was like the wood had tried to warn me, and I stubbornly refused to listen.

Eventually, I started to notice the small signals I had overlooked before: the creak of a dry board, the high-pitched squeak when nailing into damp wood, the dull thud that tells you your tools need sharpening. These details might seem insignificant, but they’re how wood communicates with you. And yes, it might sound a bit mystical—but hearing them makes all the difference.

It’s not just the sounds, though. Wood also “speaks” through its grain, its knots, and even its imperfections. Sometimes, it asks to be left alone. I remember a project where I tried to hide a big knot because I thought it didn’t fit the design. I spent hours trying to mask it with filler and sanding, but in the end, I embraced the knot and made it the centerpiece. It was the best decision I could have made.

Working with wood is an ongoing dialogue. It’s not about forcing your ideas on it, but about finding a balance. Listening means slowing down, running your hand over the surface, observing its details—letting it tell its story. Every board has something to say, and the more you learn to listen, the better your projects will be.

So next time you’re in the workshop, lower the noise and pay attention. Let the wood speak—because it does. And if you listen, I promise you’ll learn more than you expected.
